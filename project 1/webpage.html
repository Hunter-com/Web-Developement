        <summary>TRADEMILL</summary>
        &emsp;
        A treadmill is a piece of exercise equipment that has a belt that loops around, driven by a motor. The continuous loop allows a person to walk or run on the treadmill in place. Treadmills are often used as part of aerobic exercise or as a warmup before doing strength training exercises
        </details>

        <br>
        <details>
          <summary>TRAINING BENCH</summary>
          &emsp;
          A training bench is an adjustable platform used for performing weight training exercises. You should be able to adjust the backrest, so you can move it from a flat position to an incline. You'll find a range of benches online, but look for a well-constructed and easily adjustable bench. A personal training studio may need at least two of these.
        </details>

        <br>
        <details>
          <summary>DUMBBELL SET</summary>
          &emsp;
          This is probably your most important gym equipment purchase. Get a set of dumbbells, ranging from very light to very heavy, depending on who will be using them. Dumbbells come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and materials these days, from plastic-coated to colorful to straight metal, so take your pick. Get a set with a rack to save space.
        </details>

        <br>
        <details>
          <summary>BARBELL SET</summary>
          &emsp;
          You have two options for barbells: The Olympic bar (a 55-pound bar for men and 45 for women), squat rack, bench press rack and removable plates if you can afford them, or a set of fixed or easily adjustable barbells with a smaller bar. Of course, a rack for storage is essential. 
        </details>

        <br>
        <details>
          <summary>KETTLEBELLS SET</summary>
          &emsp;
          Kettlebells provide an alternative to dumbbells because they activate a slightly different muscle profile, particularly the core.
          Although not necessarily superior, they are popular and worth purchasing. Kettlebells come in a variety of weights, sizes, and even shapes.
        </details>

        <br>
        <details>
          <summary>PULL-UP FRAME AND BAR</summary>
          &emsp;
          This is for doing chin-ups and pull-ups. Look for a squat rack with a pull-up bar up top, and you'll save on cost and space
        </details>

        <br>
        <details>
          <summary>STATIONARY BICYCLE</summary>
          &emsp;
          The stationary bike is an alternative to the treadmill and rowing machine for cardiovascular endurance training. A bike provides a low-impact way to get the heart rate elevated.2 Each of these three machines emphasizes slightly different neuromuscular approaches to aerobic fitness
        </details>

        
        <br>
        <details>
          <summary>ROWING MACHINE</summary>
          &emsp;
          You can do a lot with a total-body rowing machine. Unlike the bike and treadmill that focus more on the lower body, the rower offers a head-to-toe workout, engaging the legs, core and upper body. Plus, it helps burn a ton of calories and is another option for low-impact cardio.
        </details>

        <br>
        <details>
          <summary>FITNESS BALL</summary>
          &emsp;
          You can design a lot of exercises around a fitness ball, especially core exercises. It adds an extra stability challenge to moves like chest presses, bicep curls, dead bugs, or plank knee tucks. So add it to your gym equipment arsenal.
        </details>

        <br>
        <details>
          <summary>OTHER ACESSORIES</summary>
          &emsp;
          Add smaller equipment items like a rollout wheel for abs, a wooden bar for upper body stretching, and bands and tubes for rehabilitation and resistance exercises (especially good for working the glutes).
